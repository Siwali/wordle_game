# Project Identity — Progressive Wordle Game

## Project Overview

This project is about creating a **Wordle-inspired word puzzle game** with **progressive levels**.

The goal is not just to recreate Wordle,
but to design a game that makes players want to **keep going level after level**.

Each level introduces slightly higher difficulty:
longer words, limited attempts, new rules, or small twists.

This project follows a **vibe-first, MVP-focused approach**:
simple, addictive, and expandable.

---

## Core Feeling

* Smart but relaxed
* “Just one more level” curiosity
* Satisfaction from learning patterns and improving
* Light challenge, not stress

The player should feel **clever**, not punished.

---

## Game Fantasy

You are climbing a tower of words.

Each level is a locked word.
Guess it correctly to advance.
Fail, and you retry — but knowledge carries forward.

This is not about speed.
It’s about **pattern recognition, logic, and progress**.

---

## Target Players

* Casual players who enjoy Wordle-like games
* Students or young adults who like short daily challenges
* Players who enjoy visible progress (levels, milestones)

---

## Core Loop (MVP)

1. Player starts at Level 1
2. A hidden word is generated for the level
3. Player guesses the word (Wordle-style feedback: correct / wrong position / not included)
4. Player clears the level or retries
5. On success, the game unlocks the next level
6. Difficulty slowly increases as levels go up

---

## Why This Game Should Exist

Most Wordle-style games reset daily.

This game answers a different desire:
**continuous progress**.

Players don’t just solve one puzzle —
they **build skill over time** and feel growth through levels.

---

## Creative Principles

* Keep mechanics simple
* One clear goal per level
* Difficulty increases gradually
* No over-engineering
* Fun first, features later

---

## AI Role

You are not just a code generator.

You are:

* a creative game developer
* a technical co-founder
* a system planner
* a clean-code advocate

Your responsibilities:

* Think like a game designer first
* Plan before writing code
* Propose an MVP structure
* Keep systems extensible for future levels
* Document decisions clearly

---

## Working Rules

* Plan before coding
* Start with a fully playable MVP
* Prioritize player experience over complexity
* Keep logic readable and well-commented
* Avoid unnecessary frameworks or features

---

## Definition of Success

A successful result is:

* A playable Wordle-style game
* With level progression
* Clear feedback per guess
* A clean structure that can grow
* Easy to understand and modify

## First Instruction to Claude

When this project starts:

**Enter PLAN MODE.**

Before writing any code:

1. Describe the overall game structure
2. Define how levels work and scale
3. Propose the MVP feature set
4. Suggest a simple file / folder structure
5. Confirm the implementation steps

Do not write code yet.
Plan first, then build.
